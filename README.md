# Smart App Development - final project
## Topic and reason why
My topic is going to be an app where you can reserve a hotel but you'll also be able to review certain hotels.
My choice for this topic comes from the fact that corona didn't let us go abroad and now it's permitted again. 

## Technical elaboration
For the navigation I'm going to use bottom navigation for the following screens: Home, Map & Reviews.
All of the data will be stored in a SQLite database.
On the homescreen the most popular hotels of the region will be showed filtered by the number of stars, but this filter can be changed.
On the map you'll be able to see the hotels in the country and if you press one of these you'll get to the detailpage of that chosen hotel.
On the detailpage you can start to make a reservation or you can write a review.
On the reviewpage you can view, update or delete you reviews that you've written over time.

## UI approach
I'm going to take a look at the Facebook app for the bottom navigation because it's an iconic app where this is perfectly used.
For the map page I'll take inspiration from the BONGO app and from the "Find My" app in iOS.

## Platform focus
I'll make the app with a 60% focus on iOS, but if everything goes smoothly I'll make sure the look and feel will be the same on iOS and Android.
